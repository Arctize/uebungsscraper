# uebungsscraper
A script for ETH students to automatically download all their exercises and all available solutions and material. 
Currently only works for the first semester.

## What do I need to run this program?
Python3 with the `requests` library and a folder `Uebungen` with the subfolders `AlgorithmenUndDatenstrukturen`, 
`DiskreteMathematik`, `EProg` and `LineareAlgebra` where you execute this script.

## "XY doesn't work"
Fix it yourself. Or open and issue if you think I'm not already working on it.
